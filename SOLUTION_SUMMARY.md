# Solution Summary: CEO Approval Status & Video Upload Limits

## Issue 1: "Pending CEO Approval" Status Still Showing

### Problem
The dashboard at `http://202.61.47.29:3000/dashboard/requests` was still showing "Pending CEO Approval" status even though the CEO approval mechanism was removed.

### Root Cause
The issue was caused by:
1. **E-filing System**: The `efiling_file_status` table contains a "Pending Approval" status that was being used
2. **Work Request Approvals**: Old records in the `work_request_approvals` table might still exist
3. **Status Mapping**: The main work requests system was pulling approval status from the e-filing system

### Solution Implemented
Created `fix_ceo_approval_status.sql` script that:
1. **Cleans up work_request_approvals table**: Removes or updates old CEO approval records
2. **Updates e-filing status**: Changes "Pending Approval" to "Pending Review" 
3. **Updates linked work requests**: Changes status of work requests linked to e-filing files
4. **Provides verification**: Shows cleanup results

### Files Modified
- `fix_ceo_approval_status.sql` - Database cleanup script

### How to Apply
Run the SQL script in your database:
```sql
-- Execute the fix_ceo_approval_status.sql script
```

## Issue 2: Video Upload Limit Too Low

### Problem
Users could only upload 2 videos at a time but needed to upload 10+ videos.

### Root Cause
- No explicit limit was set in the frontend, but browser/server limits were restricting uploads
- File size limits were too restrictive
- No proper error handling for multiple file uploads

### Solution Implemented

#### Frontend Changes (`app/smagent/videos/add/page.js`)
1. **Increased Limits**:
   - Maximum videos: **15 videos** (up from ~2)
   - Maximum file size: **500MB per file** (up from default)
   
2. **Enhanced Validation**:
   - File count validation with user-friendly error messages
   - File size validation with specific error details
   - Progress feedback with toast notifications

3. **Improved UI**:
   - Shows current count vs limit (e.g., "5/15 selected")
   - Clear instructions about limits
   - Better error messaging

#### Backend Changes (`app/api/videos/upload/route.js`)
1. **Server-side Validation**:
   - Validates up to 15 videos per upload
   - Validates 500MB per file limit
   - Better error messages for validation failures

#### Configuration Changes (`next.config.mjs`)
1. **Increased Body Size Limit**:
   - Set to 500MB for API routes
   - Disabled response limit for large uploads

### Files Modified
- `app/smagent/videos/add/page.js` - Frontend upload logic
- `app/api/videos/upload/route.js` - Backend validation
- `next.config.mjs` - Server configuration

### New Limits
- **Maximum Videos**: 15 per upload session
- **Maximum File Size**: 500MB per video file
- **Total Upload Size**: Up to 7.5GB per session (15 Ã— 500MB)

## Testing Recommendations

### For CEO Approval Status Fix
1. Run the SQL script
2. Check the dashboard to ensure "Pending CEO Approval" no longer appears
3. Verify that existing work requests show appropriate statuses

### For Video Upload Limits
1. Test uploading 10+ videos at once
2. Test uploading large video files (up to 500MB)
3. Test error handling with oversized files
4. Verify progress feedback and error messages

## Additional Notes

### Performance Considerations
- Large video uploads may take time - consider adding progress indicators
- Server resources may be impacted with multiple large uploads
- Consider implementing chunked uploads for very large files

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers support multiple file selection
- File size limits may vary by browser
- Consider fallback for older browsers

### Security Considerations
- File type validation is still in place
- File size limits prevent abuse
- Server-side validation prevents bypassing client limits

## Deployment Steps

1. **Database**: Run `fix_ceo_approval_status.sql`
2. **Frontend**: Deploy updated `page.js` file
3. **Backend**: Deploy updated `route.js` file  
4. **Configuration**: Deploy updated `next.config.mjs`
5. **Restart**: Restart the Next.js server to apply configuration changes

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:
- Upload success rates
- Server performance during large uploads
- Error logs for any issues
- User feedback on the new limits
